HTML is built in a tree-like structure called the Document Object Model, or DOM. 
The DOM is made up of a bunch of different tags that can be nested into each other. 
Different tags can represent each part of an HTML page, and most elements have an opening and closing one.

An opening tag looks like: 
 <element_name>  and a closing tag usually has the same  element_name  just with a  /  in the front, e.g.,  </element_name> . 
 For example, every web page has the  html  opening tag,  <html>  , and the closing tag,  </html>. 
 All the information you want in that element needs to be between the opening and closing tags. 

 types of tags:

<p>  for a paragraph element. 
<b>  for a bold element. 
<a>  for a hyperlink.
<div>  a new section or division.

The HTML tag represents the top level of the tree in the DOM and the rest of the tags are like children of the corresponding parent tags.

A couple of important things to know about HTML tags are class and id attributes, which are ways to give different HTML elements identifiers. 
You'll see a series of tags, such as  <p>  or  <h1>  , each with text inside.

The tag is a set of greater-than or less-than signs, with an element name inside that will determine how the text within the "opening" and "closing" tags will be displayed.

Tags like  <h1>  ,  <h2>  , and  <h3>  will be header elements (that's what the "h" stands for), and the  <p>  tag is a paragraph element. 
The full group consisting of one "opening" tag, the content, and one "closing" tag is called an element.
